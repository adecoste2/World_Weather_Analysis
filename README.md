# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose 
After beta testing the PlanMyTrip app recommendations from testers concured to take the app to the next level it would be ideal to add the weather description to the weather data already retrieved, add input statements to filter the data for the desired weather which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels, and then from the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally by using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route will be created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

The beta tester's recommendations were executed by:
* Deliverable 1: Retrieving Weather Data which can be found in the Weather_Database directory.
* Deliverable 2: Creating a Customer Travel Destinations Map which can be found in the Vacation_Search directory.
* Deliverable 3: Creating a Travel Itinerary Map which can be found in the Vacation_Itinerary directory.
